# Inside stat133-lab03 create a directory data

# Change to the directory data
# 
# Create a directory txt-files
# 
# Create a directory csv-files
# 
# Use the command mv to move the bread.txt file to the folder txt-files
# 
# Use the wildcard * to move all the text files to the directory txt-files
# 
# Use the wildcard * to move all the .csv files to the directory csv-files
# 
# Go back to the parent directory stat133-lab03
# 
# Create a directory copies
# 
# Use the command cp to copy the bread.txt file (the one inside the folder txt-files) to the copies directory
# 
# Use the wildcard * to copy all the .txt files in the directory copies
# 
# Use the wildcard * to copy all the .csv files in the directory copies
# 
# Change to the directory copies
# 
# Use the command mv to rename the file bread.txt as bread-recipe.txt
# 
# Rename the file Fisher.csv as iris.csv
# 
# Rename the file btaco.txt as breakfast-taco.txt
# 
# Change to the parent directory (i.e. stat133-lab03)
# 
# Rename the directory copies as copy-files
# 
# Find out how to use the rm command to delete the directory copy-files
# 
# List the contents of the directory txt-files displaying the results in reverse (alphabetical) order
